# Live Facial Detection
This repo is based off of another repo: https://github.com/GabriellArthur/Flutter-Live-Face-Detection
All the facial recognition implementation credit is due to the Author of this repo

I am taking it further to do some testing on a validation process to determine if the face is being scanned is a actual face
